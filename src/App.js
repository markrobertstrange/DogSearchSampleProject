An able sporting dog, they became an ideal working dog as well, proving their worth during World War I. Although these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of rescue groups or shelters. Opt to adopt if you want to bring one of these pups home! Intelligent, outgoing, and confident, the Airedale Terrier possesses a wonderful playful streak that delights their humans. Novice pet parents and apartment dwellers should beware, though. These dogs have high energy and need plenty of exercise, and their intensity might be a little much for first-time dog trainers. But if you can meet the breed’s physical needs and provide them with space to run, preferably in the form of a big yard with a tall, secure fence, then you’ll be rewarded with a playful, loving companion for the whole family–even kids!",

These dogs also tracked and hunted wild boar, black bear, and sometimes deer. The Akita does not back down from challenges and does not frighten easily. Consequently, they are fearless and loyal guardians of their families. Yet they are also affectionate, respectful, and amusing dogs when properly trained and socialized. An Akita is bound to shed quite a bit, and you may be wiping some drool from their face if you bring one home. Certainly, owners should be prepared for some cleanup. Furthermore, they tend to be stubborn and are not overly fond of strangers. While those can be good traits for a watchdog, they’ll need an experienced trainer if they’re to interact with other animals or people. Novices beware. That said, dogs of this breed are faithful companions that will be attached to the right human for life and shower them with adoration and love. Therefore, if you and your family are up for the challenge and consider adopting an Akita, you’ll have a lifelong friend who won’t let you down. Also, see all Akita dog breed characteristics below!",

It reigns as one of the oldest dog breeds whose original looks have not been significantly altered. This intelligent canine needs a job and consistent leadership to avoid becoming bored or challenging to handle. Novice pet parents, beware. Dogs of this breed are sensitive and need plenty of companionship and open space. They are not well-suited to apartment life, and they are certainly high-shedding pooches who need plenty of grooming to keep their coats healthy. Expect to clean up dog hair all year long, and especially during shedding season. Alaskan Malamutes are high-energy dogs, and therefore require vigorous exercise. If you plan to leave them home while you’re at work, you may see some anxious, destructive behavior. A dog walker or pet sitter during the day is practically a must if you can’t be home, yourself. An Alaskan Malamute will do well with an experienced pet parent, lots of open space to roam and burn off energy, and a cooler climate.

The’ll bark and bay at home, too, making them a poor choice if you’ve got nearby neighbors. They need lots of exercise. Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. These dogs are loving, intelligent, easy to train, and fairly easy to groom. However, novice pet parents should beware. They also need firm, consistent training and lots of mental and physical activity. If you can’t keep up with seemingly endless walks and play sessions, you may want to consider a less energetic breed. But if you can provide the exercise they need, a very secure yard for them to roam, and patient training, you’ll have an adoring furry family member.",

American Staffordshire Terriers enjoy nothing more than being with the humans they care about, whether they’re out for a jog, playing in the yard, or cuddling up on the couch. They are intelligent and eager to please, which makes them highly trainable; although, that intelligence means they need mental stimulation. If they don’t get it, they’ll put those strong jaws to use and chew anything out of boredom. American Staffordshire Terriers can also use their strength to pull dog walkers along with ease wherever they want to go if they aren’t trained properly. This means they need a strong, confident trainer who will set boundaries without being overly harsh. Socialization is also important to help the breed overcome its natural standoffish tendencies when it comes to other animals. This breed loves having a job to do, and they do well in athletic competitions, police work, and obedience training. With proper training, the American Staffordshire Terrier can be a loyal cuddle bug and family companion, as well as a competent working dog.",

They were created with specific traits to resemble the size and color of livestock they defended so predators wouldn’t detect them among the flock. Sometimes called the Anatolian Karabash Dog or Kangal (which is considered a separate breed by many kennel clubs), they’re a fiercely loyal guard dog and a large, impressive dog breed, frequently weighing 120 to 150 pounds at maturity. Novice pet parents beware. Not only are dogs of this breed big; they’re generally known to be stubborn. Anatolian Shepherd Dogs require firm, consistent trainers with experience handling dogs. Also, be ready to clean up all the fur they shed throughout the year. A trained and well-socialized Anatolian Shepherd is a friend and guardian for anyone they consider to be their “flock,” which includes the human members of their family. They’re even friendly with their human children; although, their size makes it easy for them to knock over a kid during vigorous play. They may also chase other pets or animals if their humans don’t train them properly. Therefore, socialization and behavior training should start early on, ideally in puppyhood. If you’re willing to stay firm with training, you have the strength to handle a large pooch, and you’re willing to put in the time and dedication, then an Anatolian Shepherd Dog will be your friend and guardian for life.",

Developed by Australian settlers to handle herds of cattle on expansive ranches, they’re still used today as a herding dog. They thrive on having a job to do and on being part of all family activities. Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Australian Cattle Dogs are loyal and protective of their families, though wary of outsiders. Besides herding work, they do well at canine sports, including agility, obedience, rally, flyball, and flying disc competitions. Novice pet parents and apartment dwellers beware; these dogs need a lot — a lot! — of mental and physical activity to stay happy and healthy, and to prevent bored, destructive behavior. If you have a home with plenty of room to run, and you can keep up with such an active pup, this may be the breed for you!",

        "description": "The Australian Kelpie was originally bred to have the energy, intelligence, and independence to herd livestock all day in the hot Australian climate without much need for supervision. They retain those qualities to this day. People still use Australian Kelpies across Australia and the United States for their herding instincts. That suits these dogs just fine, as they’re happiest when they have a job to do. Those who want to keep one of these dogs as a pet would do well to remember that because a bored Australian Kelpie may make their own fun by acting out and engaging in destructive behavior. The good news is that these dogs are easy to train for almost any task, so long as they have a confident, competent trainer who can give positive reinforcement without being too harsh. Australian Kelpies are fully capable of performing many dog sports, search and rescue work, nose work, service dog duties, and more. They have high energy and high exercise needs. While they can handle doing a job with little supervision, they need human companionship and direction. Leaving them home alone for long periods of time can spell disaster. Their natural herding instincts need to be contained and used properly from an early age; otherwise, they may end up nipping at the heels of children, other pets, and even guests. But with time and training, they can make loyal companions who excel as watchdogs and work tirelessly at any task.",

These dogs use both scent and sight to hunt and were originally used to flush small game into hunters’ nets and to control village rodent populations. These days, they also make for great, loving, furry family members. Although they’re purebred dogs, you may find Basenjis in shelters or in the care of rescue groups.

They can adapt to apartment living, and even novice pet parents will find these pups to be great first-timer dogs. Just make sure you can provide enough exercise to meet their high energy levels.

They later graduated to police work, and today their versatility makes them suitable for many jobs and dog sports. Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Belgian Sheepdogs are alert, devoted, and protective. They’re also highly sensitive and affectionate, and they can make for excellent family companions. That said, they do need plenty of exercise and mental stimulation to stay happy. A bored dog can quickly become a destructive dog. They need room to run and a securely fenced yard, as these pups have a tendency to chase just about anything that moves, whether it’s a biker peddling by or a wayward squirrel. If you have the energy to keep up with this pup, you’ll be rewarded with a loving, loyal, furry family member.",

        "description": "The Bernese Mountain Dog is an extremely versatile working dog from the farmlands of Switzerland. They were developed to herd cattle, pull carts, and be watchdogs and loyal companions. They’re one of four types of Swiss Mountain Dogs, and the only one with long hair. The Bernese Mountain Dog comes from the canton of Bern, hence their name. They’re a large and sturdy dog breed, with a friendly and calm disposition, and they’re also well-suited to conformation, obedience, tracking, herding, and carting competitions. A novice dog parent might be attracted to this breed’s friendly disposition, intelligence, and highly trainable nature. However, first-timers should beware. The Bernese Mountain Dog’s size and high energy can make handling difficult. Thus, they don’t appreciate being cooped up in apartments all day. They shed a lot, and they tend to need the drool wiped from their faces every once in a while. Dogs of this breed are great watchdogs, but that also means they have a tendency to bark — loudly. They may want to chase smaller animals and play roughly, even though they are quite gentle when fully mature and trained properly. Although, for an experienced pet parent who can match the Bernese’s energy, provide open space, keep up with grooming, and dedicate time and effort to training, this breed will show unconditional love and loyalty. A well-trained Bernese makes an excellent companion that will adore the whole family. They love kids and will even greet newcomers to the home warmly, so long as they’ve had adequate socialization training. There aren’t many breeds with a greater predisposition for friendliness. Therefore, if you’re ready for the challenge, you’ll never regret adopting a Bernese Mountain Dog. See all Bernese Mountain Dog characteristics below!",

        "description": "The Blue Lacy, also called the Lacy Dog, is an energetic, intelligent, and trainable breed that loves having a job to do and a lot of open space to run around. Even though the breed has “Blue” in its name, Blue Lacys can also have red or tri-colored coats; although, they all carry the blue color gene. The “Lacy” in the breed’s name does not refer to the dog’s appearance at all, but rather comes from the name of the family that first created the breed. The Blue Lacy was developed in the 1800s to help with herding, hunting, and ranch work in Texas. These dogs are hardy, adaptable, and able to learn quickly, though their high intensity and energy level make them ill-suited for apartment life or novice owners. Blue Lacys can make great family dogs and expert watchdogs with firm training, but they are sensitive and don’t respond well to punishment. Socialization should begin early, as Blue Lacys are naturally territorial, not overly trusting of strangers, and have a high prey drive that can cause them to attack smaller animals and pets if they aren’t socialized. With confident, assertive training that relies on positive reinforcement, dogs of this breed can be loyal, protective, and capable members of the family who are eager to please. Experienced pet parents who can give this dog a task will find a lifelong friend who’ll rise to any challenge.",

Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Dogs of this breed are highly sensitive and affectionate. With proper socialization training, they’ll even get along with kids in the home. However, with their high energy levels and exercise needs, they don’t make for the best apartment pets.

However, this breed is equally known for being loving, calm, and family-friendly, especially towards human children. These gigantic protectors were bred to help farmers in South Africa defend their homesteads from hyenas, lions, and all manner of deadly wildlife while also providing invaluable companionship. The Boerboel, pronounced “boo-r-bull,” gets its name from Dutch/Afrikaans words that roughly translate to “farmer’s dog.” It is also known as the South African Mastiff, South African Boerboel, Borbull, or Bole. Although Boerboels are generally docile, easy to groom, and have few health problems, don’t make the mistake of thinking they’re an easy breed to handle for first time owners. These dogs are confident, territorial, and prone to pulling and chewing. They need an assertive, experienced owner with plenty of space for a massive dog that needs to exercise. If you’re interested in adopting a Boerboel, then make sure you and your home are ready for the challenge. If you are, you’ll be rewarded with a loyal, protective friend for life.",

        "description": "The Borzoi dog breed was developed in Russia as a coursing and hunting dog. These hounds hunted in teams of three to go after rabbit, foxes, and wolves. They later became popular as a companion for royalty across continental Europe. Although these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Consider adoption if this is the breed for you. Borzois are laid-back family dogs who can even adapt to apartment living, despite their large size. They do not, however, fair well when left alone for long periods of time during the day. This sensitive breed needs companionship. Their beautiful coat also sheds a lot and requires some maintenance on your part. You’ll get a great couch potato buddy with a Borzoi, but you’ll still have to put in some effort to meet the breed’s needs.",

        "description": "In their native Italy, the Bracco Italiano is known as a hunting dog breed, but they’re also gaining notice as a sweet and affectionate family companion. With their long ears, droopy lips, and soulful expression, the Bracco Italiano has a distinctive look. They’re believed to be an ancient breed, dating back to the fourth or fifth century B.C. The Bracco Italiano goes by a number of other names, including Italian Pointer, The Italian Pointing Dog, and Bracco. If this dog breed interests you, then you may find these adorable pups in shelters or breed specific rescues. Remember, it’s always better to adopt and not shop! These smart dogs have endless amounts of energy and do best in homes with yards. The Bracco is also well suited for all households, from single individuals to large families with children. Though they are not watchdog material, they will let you know if they sense a change in their environment. If you want an energetic dog who will keep you on your toes and love you unconditionally, the Bracco Italiano may be the right dog for you!",

True to their French roots, they can be aloof with strangers, but are affectionate and loving toward members of their pack.

Bred as herding and guard dogs to protect flocks and fight off predators, these canines were adopted as working dogs during World War I and used by troops as sentries, ammunition carriers, messengers, and medic dogs. Today, the Briard enjoys the life of a companion dog, but they show their versatility and working nature with their great successes in obedience, agility, conformation, herding, carting, and tracking competitions.",

These dogs also have quite a bit of energy for their size and need lots of exercise and playtime.

        "description": "The Bulldog was originally used to drive cattle to market and to compete in a bloody sport called bullbaiting. Today, they’re gentle companions who love kids. Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. A brief walk and a nap on the sofa is just this dog breed‘s speed. Bulldogs can adapt well to apartment life and even make great companions for novice pet parents. They’re affectionate with all members of the family and are fairly low-maintenance pups. Just make sure to keep them out of extreme weather, and also give them enough exercise, as weight gain is a risk with these dogs who are happy to spend most of the day on the couch. Did you know they make dog food specifically for Bulldogs?",

Compact and affectionate, these dogs do well in apartments and large homes with novice pet parents and experienced dog lovers, alike. They do, however, have high energy and will need their humans to keep them active with walks and play sessions.

They’re also known as Caucasian Mountain Dogs, Russian Bear Dogs, Baskhan (Karachay) Pariy, Caucasian Ovcharka Dogs, or just CO, and there are many variants and types. This massive breed is highly territorial and won’t back down from a fight, even against bears or wolves. Caucasian Shepherd Dogs are intelligent, but their stubborn, independent nature can make them difficult to train. Their natural distrust of strangers and other animals can also lead to aggressive tendencies if an experienced trainer doesn’t keep them in check. This breed is not a good choice for novice owners, and though they are fairly low-energy dogs, the sheer size of Caucasian Shepherd Dogs makes them poorly suited for apartment living and homes with small children. Still, with proper training and socialization, Caucasian Shepherd Dogs can make strong watchdogs, family companions, and even therapy dogs.

They can almost read your mind and will lie in bed for hours without moving a muscle. Although these are purebred dogs, you may still find them in shelters and rescues. Chinese Cresteds have almost no desire to go out and run around like regular dogs; although, they’re athletic enough to jump surprisingly tall fences and compete in agility. They’re not gregarious, but they are intensely social and bond quickly within their pack. They don’t accept strangers easily. Once a Crested falls in love with you, you’ll have a little stalker on your hands — they’ll be eternally, thoroughly devoted.",

They were developed to guard, hunt, herd, and later on to fight, unfortunately. Today, they’re known for their characteristic short, bristly coat, loose, wrinkled skin, and devotion to their family. Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. In modern times, the Shar-Pei mostly enjoys life as a beloved companion. They can even adapt to apartment life. However, your neighbors might not appreciate your pooch’s barking tendencies. Novice pet parents should beware, as these dogs need plenty of firm, consistent training, which won’t be easy with their natural stubborn tendencies. Early socialization will go a long way. If you can meet the breed’s needs, you’ll have a protective watchdog and a loyal best friend.",

These days they’re multipurpose dogs who are happy hiking, competing in agility and other dog sports, pulling a sled or other conveyance, and playing with the kids. Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Chinooks are generally sensitive and gentle dogs with a pleasant demeanor. They’re exceptionally smart and loving with their family members, including kids and other dogs. Novice pet parents should beware, though, because these dogs need experienced, consistent training. Although they can adapt to apartment life, these dogs would prefer homes with big yards to run around — and those yards need to be secure. Chinooks are diggers, so make sure your yard’s fence is tough and capable of preventing Houdini-like escape attempts.",

        "description": "Dachshunds are scent hound dogs bred to hunt badgers and other tunneling animals, rabbits, and foxes. Hunters even used packs of Dachshunds to trail wild boar. Today their versatility makes them excellent family companions, show dogs, and small-game hunters. But don’t let this pup fool you. Dogs of this breed might be, as legendary literary critic and humorous journalist H. L. Mencken said, “half a dog high and a dog and a half long,” but this small, drop-eared dog is tough enough to take on a badger. In fact, that’s how they got their name (Dachs meaning badger; hund meaning dog). However, you may know them by one of their many nicknames, including Wiener Dog, Sausage Dog, Doxie, and more. If you’re looking a little pooch who will keep you on your toes and shower you with love, this may be the breed for you. Opt to adopt if you can!",

If you’re a traveler, this pup makes an easy travel companion and would love to tag along, wherever the road leads you.",

        "description": "If you were the type of kid who wasn’t afraid to choose the “mystery” flavor of candy in a bag, a Dachshund Poodle — or Doxiepoo — may be for you. While this mixed breed can have famously endless combinations of traits, they are known for being affectionate, intelligent, and playful. The list of names the Doxiepoo is known by is as long as the parent Dachshund: Doodle, Dachdoodle, Doxiedoodle, Doxiepoodle, Dachshunddoodle, and Dachshundpoo. This is one of the most unpredictable pairings among mixed breeds, even within a single litter. This means they often end up in shelters. However, with such winning traits, they are wonderfully adoptable dogs. And, as one of the most affectionate mixed breeds, they’ll fall in love with you before you leave the shelter. Because they’re so loving and loyal, Doxiepoos work best with families who don’t mind spending plenty of time with them. They do well with children, but they do best in single-pet homes. Vigilant watchdogs, Doxiepoos may be “yappy,” so owners should be prepared. Also, because it’s hard to know how this mix may turn out, owners who need “hypoallergenic” dogs should probably meet this mixed breed before bringing one home. Doxiepoos are energetic but adapt well to both apartments and houses, provided they are given enough exercise time.",

That, plus their high level of energy and need for lots of exercise makes them a better fit for people who have time in their schedules to be home for a good portion of the day.

In modern times, they find jobs as police dogs, service animals, and family-friendly companions. You may take a look at the Dutch Shepherd and notice a striking resemblance to German Shepherds or Belgian Shepherds. That’s because these cousin breeds share a close ancestry and only diverged a little over a hundred years ago. While Dutch Shepherds are more rare than many other shepherd breeds, they are known to be some of the healthiest and easiest to train. They come in three different kinds of coats that are beautifully brindle. If you want a dog that will do well in competitions, act as a watchdog, keep you active, love your family, and provide loyal, affectionate, obedient companionship, you’d get all of the above and more in a Dutch Shepherd.",

Today they’re considered “talkative” companions who will keep you apprised of just about everything going on in your surroundings. Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. These dogs are very loving and playful, but they do require firm, consistent training. That may prove difficult with their independent streak, and they’ll need a securely fenced yard because they love to bark at people and animals who walk past — and sometimes even chase them.

And they’re amazingly versatile. The breed also goes by the name Alsatian. Despite their purebred status, you may find German Shepherds in shelters and breed specific rescues. So Don’t shop if this is the breed for you. GSDs excel at most anything they’re trained to do: guide and assistance work for the handicapped, police and military service, herding, search and rescue, drug detection, competitive obedience, and — last but not least — faithful companion.",

Compact and easy to groom, these dogs can adapt to apartments and large homes easily so long as they get enough exercise and active playtime. Due to their history of hunting small game, Glen of Imaal Terriers retain their love of digging. You may want to create a designated digging area outdoors to let your dog get the urge out of their system.

The breed’s friendly, tolerant attitude makes them great family pets, and their intelligence makes them highly capable working dogs. Golden Retrievers excel at retrieving game for hunters, tracking, sniffing out contraband for law enforcement, and as therapy and service dogs. They’re also natural athletes and do well in dog sports such as agility and competitive obedience. These dogs are fairly easy to train and get along in just about any home or family. They’re great with kids and very protective of their humans. If you want a loyal, loving, and smart companion, consider adopting one of these pups into your pack.",

        "description": "The Irish Terrier dog breed was once described as the “poor man’s sentinel, the farmer’s friend, and the gentleman’s favorite.” Rugged and stouthearted, they have the advantages of a convenient size, versatile abilities as a companion, watchdog, and vermin dispatcher, and high train-ability. Even though these are purebred dogs, some may still end up in the care of shelters or rescues. Consider adoption if this is the breed for you. Irish Terriers are super affectionate toward the humans in their lives, though they may prefer to be the solo pet in the home. Early socialization can help them warm up to other dogs and pets. This breed also has high energy and will need a good amount of exercise. Apartment dwellers and those who must leave home for long hours of the day may have a hard time meeting the Irish Terrier’s physical needs. But if you can provide plenty of attention, patience, and space to move, you’ll have a loving, lifelong companion.",

Generally the Poodle parent is Miniature or Toy sized, as opposed to Standard. Affectionate, lively, and intelligent, Jack-A-Poos are energetic pups who make great family dogs. The Jack-A-Poo has many other names, including Jack-A-Doodle, Jackadoodle, Jackdoodle, Jackapoodle, Jack A Poo, Jackapoo, Jack-A-Poodle, Jackpoo, Poojack, and Poo-Jack. They are considered “designer dogs,” bred on purpose to emphasize desirable characteristics from each breed. As always, please adopt if you’re looking to add one of these dogs to your life. You can find them at shelters and breed specific rescues. Remember, when you adopt, you save two lives: the one you bring home and the one you make room for at the rescue. These little balls of energy would be well-suited to apartment living due to their small-to-medium size, but only if the owner can take them out for plenty of exercise. Otherwise, they might prefer to live in a house that has space for running around. It’s important to give your Jack-A-Poo plenty of attention and keep them stimulated, so their hardworking, clever nature can be used for good–otherwise, they could become destructive and bark a lot. However, these behaviors can be nipped in the bud with early training. If you’re ready for a high-energy friend who wants to be by your side as much as possible, this might be a great pup for you!",

He’s almost exclusively a companion dog today. Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Keeshonds are people-lovers; willing to participate in all family activities, they thrive with people who expect this of their dog. They’re lively, alert, and intelligent — qualities that won them status as the most beloved dog in Holland. These adaptable pups can even make good apartment pets, but beware that they have a tendency to bark — something neighbors might not appreciate. They also won’t enjoy being left home alone for long hours of the day. If you can meet the breed’s needs, you’ll have a loving, fluffy family member.",

        "description": "The Kerry Blue Terrier is the quintessential working dog. They hail from County Kerry, Ireland, where they were bred to hunt small game and birds, kill rodents, and herd sheep and cattle. Intelligent and brave, they became a cherished pet as well, displaying fierce devotion to their family or pack. Even though these are purebred dogs, some may still end up in the care of shelters or rescues. Consider adoption if this is the breed for you. While not a particularly well-known dog breed, the Kerry Blue enjoys a dedicated following of fanciers, thanks to their working abilities and loyal companionship. They’re also quite friendly to just about all people, and they learn quickly despite being a bit strong willed from time to time. They do not, however, take quickly to other dogs and may prefer to be the solo pet in the home. Still, with patient training and plenty of exercise, these pups can make for loving and devoted members of the family.",

Modern Labs work as retrievers for hunters, assistance dogs, show competitors, and search and rescue dogs, among other canine jobs.",

They’re also known as Italian Water Dogs and Romagna Water Dogs. Today, with many of the marshlands of the breed’s homeland drained, these dogs have found a new purpose in truffle hunting. Humans can easily train them to use their super noses for scent work. Lagottos’ thick coats help them stay warm in fall and winter while protecting them from thorns and debris as they run through forests. They’re the only dogs bred for the specific purpose of truffle hunting in modern times. Their keen sense of smell and natural tendency to dig make them experts at the task. Lagotto Romagnolos can also make loving, active, easygoing household pets with few demands. Their hypoallergenic coats are good for allergy sufferers, though those coats require a good deal of maintenance. So, if you can keep up with grooming and brushing and you want a dedicated, easily-trained companion — or someone to help you hunt for delicious truffles — then this dog may fit right in with your family.

Today’s Lakies, as these lively, feisty little dogs are nicknamed, are affectionate, friendly, and self-confident. Even though these are purebred dogs, some may still end up in the care of shelters or rescues. Consider adoption if this is the breed for you. The Lakeland Terrier is an affectionate dog when it comes to the humans in their life. Even though they have high energy and exercise needs, their small size can help them adapt to apartment living, so long as they get plenty of physical activity. For a home with a backyard, a high, sturdy fence is a must to prevent roaming and wildlife chasing. These dogs respond well to confident pet parents who can set boundaries. Give this pup lots of patient training and active playtime, and you’ll have a loving, furry family member.",

Active and charming, they’ll fit into all kinds of homes: apartment or house, family with kids or elderly single. Although these dogs sometimes have the unfortunate status of “designer breed,” you may find them in shelters and rescues. Maltipoos are highly affectionate and would make a great choice for a novice pet parent. However, they’re highly sensitive and do not like being left alone for long periods of the day. As companion dogs, they crave the company of their humans and may develop separation anxiety when they don’t get the attention they need. But if you can provide a loving home that meets this mix’s needs, you’ll have an adoring family member who can dish out plenty of cuddle sessions.",

The Gentleman’s Terrier (as they’re known in Victorian England) is not a sparring dog but loves a good chase. This makes them a flyball and agility rock star. Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Though their looks may remind you of a miniature Doberman Pinscher or a large Miniature Pinscher, the Manchester Terrier is their own canine. A wee dog with a strong bark, they’ve got personality to burn: loyal, hearty, and a terrific watchdog who adores hanging out with their people. Among terriers, the Manchester is known to be one of the more well-mannered and responsive breeds and today spends their time as a terrific companion who can hold up their end of the conversation.",

Easy to train and eager to learn, Pembrokes are great with children and other pets, and you can find them in four different coat colors and markings. Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Adaptable and loving with the whole family, Corgis can fit into just about any household, whether it’s an apartment or large home with a yard. However, they do have quite a bit of energy for a small dog. They’ll need plenty of walks and active play sessions. You might be surprised by how quickly these short-legged pups can move! For humans who can meet the breed’s needs, the Pembroke will make an excellent family companion, even for novice pet parents.",

Although the dog breed appears to be designed for winsome cuteness, in actuality, PBGVs are tough hunters who were developed for a specific purpose: to hunt small game in the rough terrain of the Vendeen region of France. The breed is known for a merry and outgoing personality. Even though these are purebred dogs, some may still end up in the care of shelters or rescues. Consider adoption if this is the breed for you. Adaptable and affectionate, these pups can fair well in apartment living situations. They do have high energy levels, though, and because of that, they need plenty of exercise. PBGVs can also have a stubborn streak, so they’ll need plenty of consistent training with lots of positive reinforcement. If you can provide this pooch with lots of physical activity and care, you’ll be rewarded with a loving companion for the whole family, even for other resident canines.",

Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Poms may be small, but they don’t always act that way and may even challenge larger dogs. While they make for good apartment pets, they can also bark a lot, which your neighbors may not be too thrilled about. But as long as you give your dog plenty of exercise and playtime, keep them out of hot weather, and give them lots of love and attention, you’ll have a loving, adorable, furry family companion!",

However, they also bark a lot when they’re not on the hunt, and take a lot of patience to train. Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Sensitive and affectionate, these dogs adore their human families and can even make great playmates for kids so long as they go through early socialization training. Of course, you must always supervise playtime between children and dogs — even well trained dogs. As an intelligent and energetic breed, Redbone Coonhounds need plenty of mental and physical exercise, or else they may get bored and act out. Keep them busy, and you’ll have a happy, active family companion.",

        "description": "The original purpose of the Scottish Deerhound dog breed was to hunt and bring down the Scottish roe deer, a magnificent beast twice or more the dog’s size. Today, if the Scottish Deerhound were writing a personals ad, they’d say that they enjoy long walks, opportunities to run, regular meals, and a nice sofa to nap on. Even though these are purebred dogs, some may still end up in the care of shelters or rescues. Consider adoption if this is the breed for you. Although these dogs are highly affectionate to the humans in their lives, they don’t fair as well in apartment living situations or with novice pet parents. They’re large and energetic, which means they need room to run. These dogs need an experienced trainer who can stay firm and consistent. They also don’t like being left at home alone for long hours of the day. If you’ve got the strength and endurance to meet this breed’s needs, you’ll have a loyal, loving companion for life.",

        "description": "The Silken Windhound is an affectionate, playful, and eager-to-please dog breed. They’re easily trained and love their families, including those with small children and pets. In fact, their affectionate nature makes them poor watchdogs. That’s because they are likely to react to strangers with warm greetings instead of barks or growls. As a relatively new breed, the Silken Windhound is not recognized by the American Kennel Club; although, it was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 2011 and appears in shows and competitions around the world. Silken Windhounds can be trained for obedience, agility, and dog sports. Furthermore, they tend to pick up such training quickly and easily with their intelligence and desire to please the humans that they are close to. However their high prey drive must be redirected into positive behavior or they may bolt after small animals and wander. Although these dogs are relaxed most of the time and are happy to curl up on the couch with their families, they also have bursts of high energy and require exercise in the form of at least one long walk or run per day. If their exercise needs are met, they are happy to adapt to almost any living situation, including apartment life. Their long, beautiful coats come in many patterns and colors, and despite their luxurious looks, they’re surprisingly easy to maintain and do not shed too much. Silken Windhounds make great, active family companions for novice and experienced pet parents, alike, and their long life span will keep them around for many years of love and affection.",

However, they can suffer from separation anxiety if left alone all day; plus, they sometimes have a reputation for being better suited to living with adults rather than children.",

Terripoos are also known as Terri Poos, Terridoodles, and Terrypoos. They are considered “designer dogs,” bred on purpose to emphasize desirable characteristics from each breed. As always, please adopt if you’re looking to add a Terripoo to your life. In addition to shelters, these dogs can be found at Terrier and Poodle breed specific rescues. Remember, when you adopt, you save two lives: the one you bring home and the one you make room for at the rescue. These dogs are quite versatile and can do well with young children and even other animals, but supervised introductions are necessary, especially due to their Terrier ancestry–and because of that same ancestry, you may want to stay away from mixing small animals, like rodents, into the group. Wanting to be part of all family activity, Terripoos do best when they get sufficient attention. But with their small size, they don’t need a lot of space. If you’re looking for a loving little dog who can read your moods and alert you when danger is near or something is amiss, a Terripoo might be for you!",

But their fans are more interested in their ability to send prey up a tree and hold it until the hunter arrives.

Some are shy, some are confident, but they’re all hounds — meaning, they need patient training and plenty of exercise. Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. With high energy and a habit of sounding off, these pups might not be a great choice for apartment dwellers. They need a good amount of exercise and room to roam. Those with big backyards can provide a more suitable home, so long as the yard is securely fenced. These dogs have hunting instincts and may choose to take off after critters that wander past. Although Treeing Walker Coonhounds may vary in personality traits, they all need plenty of physical activity and an experienced trainer to stay happy and well behaved.",

Their ability to run fast and jump high can be surprising to those who aren’t expecting a canine Superman in miniature. Their sense of hearing is uncanny, and present near impossible odds for anyone attempting to quietly sneak up on a house with a member of this breed residing there. Even novice pet parents will find these sweet pups to be amazing companions.",

          "description": "A fun-loving “designer dog” — and therefore a mixed dog breed — a Yorkipoo is a cross between the Yorkshire Terrier and a Toy or Miniature Poodle. Intelligent, affectionate, and gentle, he makes a delightful companion and is perfectly suited to apartment life, especially if you don’t mind the barking. He has plenty of energy to be burned off and he loves to play when he’s not parked on your lap watching the world go by. His ability to run fast and jump high can be surprising to those who aren’t expecting a canine Superman in miniature. Their sense of hearing is uncanny, and present near impossible odds for anyone attempting to quietly sneak up on a house with a member of this breed residing there.",
